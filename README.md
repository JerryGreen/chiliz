# [Числитель или Знаменатель](https://chiliz.ru/)

> This repository may look overcomplicated in details. And it is! For the purpose it's done initially, "just to show oddness of the week", – of course its architecture is complicated. It may be much more lean. That's my project I experiment with. I want unified architecture / development flow / etc, so I just play here with some important aspects for me. This helps me with the real projects, big projects.
